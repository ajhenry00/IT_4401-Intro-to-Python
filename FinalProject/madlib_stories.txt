This is an example text with a 1stNoun in it.

There once was a fine, noble creature, a(n) 1stNoun of noble heritage named Name.
Name was a well-travelled 1stNoun, having gone from 1stPlace to 2ndPlace.
And yet, through all their travels, Name had not reached their goal: the ultimate sandwich.
There had been plenty of sandwiches along the way that had brought them joy and pleased the contents of their BodyPart,
but none had given them the out-of-body experience as the sandwich they could all but remember the contents of from their
childhood. One day, Name wandered to the nearby town of Townname, 1stMovingVerbPastTense into a 1stBuilding in a drunken stupor.
There, they met a decrepit old 2ndNoun in a similar forlorn state. There, the old 2ndNoun described a sandwich, and as the
2ndNoun kept going, it became more clear to Name even in the state their mind was in that this was the sandwich they long
sought after. Name tried as they could to hang on every detail the old 2ndNoun gave regarding the contents and location.
However, when morning came, Name only remembered the faint murmur of the old 2ndNoun: "go to the 2ndBuilding in the Place
where the PluralNoun are 1stAdjective, there you will find your sandwich". Name jolted out of bed, put on their Clothes
and 2ndMovingVerbPastTense out the door to the 2ndBuilding in the Place. Upon reaching their destination, Name was 2ndAdjective, just
imagining their goal finally being reached. Upon entering, Name was greeted by the strange odor of 3rdNoun. Looking up
slowly, Name's gaze was drawn to the golden, glistening Object. On top, was the sandwich of their childhood, as if it
had just descended from Heaven to bless their stomach with its contents. Name started from the bottom, and remembered:
3rdAdjective bread, then savory 1stFood, followed by a zesty 2ndFood, and finally a spicy 3rdFood under another 3rdAdjective
bread slice. Name took their first bite, and a feeling of Emotion filled their stomach. Their life goal was complete, and had
come to a close. The End
